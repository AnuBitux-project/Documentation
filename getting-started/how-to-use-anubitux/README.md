# How to use AnuBitux

AnuBitux is a Linux distribution designed to only work in live mode, so that it leaves no trace on the devices used to run it. It is also unable to permanently store any kind of file and configuration: it will look the same at every reboot.

To use the AnuBitux distro, it needs to be flashed on an USB device. It can be done in many different ways, like using [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html), [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/), [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/), etc.
