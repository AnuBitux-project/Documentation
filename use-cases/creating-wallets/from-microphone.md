# From microphone

It is also possible to obtain wallets (paper wallets or mnemonic seeds) using entropy grabbed with the microphone, using the Mic2Paper and the Mic2Seed tool.

They only need to be started from the menu and then they will automatically record a 30 seconds audio deriving entropy from it.

#### Caution

It is  very important to use proper working hardware. There also is a tool named MicCheck in the Wallet Generators menu. It will record a 5 seconds audio and play it. If nothing is heard, it may be a good idea to check if the hardware is working properly, even from the Sounds Settings.

Never use this tool into a virtual machine to generate wallets that have to be used in real scenarios.&#x20;
